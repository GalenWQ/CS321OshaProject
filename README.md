# HW #3: HeatMiser meets OSHA

Galen Berger-Fletcher, Dustin Michels


## How to run

If the requite packages are installed, the code can be run from the command line with:

`python3 osha.py`

This will run our pure-python implementation of decision trees and k-means clustering, and automatically generate graphs that get written to the `images/` folder.

Additionally, the code for implementing a decision tree with Scikit Learn can be seen in the jupyter notebook `notebooks/sklearn_tree.ipynb`.
